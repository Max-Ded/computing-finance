## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of projects and materials developed as part of my Mathematics & Finance MSc program. It is intended to showcase the practical applications of mathematical and financial concepts through programming languages such as Python and C++. The projects included here explore various areas of interest within the field of finance and demonstrate the integration of mathematical models and algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## Subjects Covered

The repository covers a wide range of subjects related to mathematics and finance. Some of the main topics explored are:

- Algorithmic Trading
- C and C++ programming
- Python programming
- Portfolio Management
- Market Microstructure

Please refer to the individual project folders for more details on the specific subjects covered within each project.

## Code and Notebooks

The code and notebooks in this repository are organized into separate folders for each project. You will find detailed documentation, explanations, and examples within each project's folder. The code is written in Python and C++ depending on the project.

Feel free to explore the code, run the notebooks, and modify them to suit your needs. Each project folder contains a `README` file that provides specific instructions and requirements for running the code.

## Reports

In addition to the code and notebooks, this repository includes reports documenting the projects completed during the Mathematics & Finance MSc program. These reports provide in-depth analyses, methodologies, and results for each project. They offer valuable insights into the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of the concepts covered.

You will find the reports in the respective project folders, accompanying the code and notebooks. We encourage you to read through the reports to gain a comprehensive understanding of the projects.

## Installation

To run the code and notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Python and C++ development environments set up on your machine. Please refer to the individual project's `README` file for detailed installation instructions, including any additional dependencies or libraries required.
